Example code for calculating basis statistics of dewey analysis data.

# Usage

You can collect the statistics for an analysis file and write the results to a file using the following command. The code isn't particularly optimized and can take over half an hour to run.

```sh
clojure -M:stats path/to/analysis.edn.gz stats-output.edn
```
